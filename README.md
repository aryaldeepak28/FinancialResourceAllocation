# FinancialResourceAllocation

This project aims to form a Genetic algorithm for financial resource allocation for victims of a disaster.

Parameters for availing financial help: Economic background, Age
 
Constraints: Total aiding amount should be less than or equal to the amount of money at disposal and should be as close to it as possible.
 
Chromosome Encoding: A list with no of columns = no of victims. Each list item contains an ID to the cost table (amount of help given).
 
Objectives: 
1. Maximise the number of individuals receiving financial help.
2. Maximise the number of individuals who have poor economic background OR Minimise the economic fitness of individuals receiving financial help.
3. Maximise the number of senior citizens and kids.
4. Maximise the amount given out as help.
